# Daily-Medicine
* An android application for Patients (who take alot of medicines daily) to help them remembering each time to take each medicine, knowing how many times they took it and to remember if they took it or not by sending a notification for each medicine at each of their times every day with two actions (took it, missed it), if (took it) action pressed, number of how many times patient took it will increase by one and if (missed it) action clicked, the notification will be dismissed with no changes to the app.

* Every day at 12:00 AM, the number of how many times patient took medicine for all medicines in the database will be updated to 0 to start counting for the new day.

* All entered medicines will be shown in a list view, each item will present medicine name, how many times user pressed (took it) action that was on the notification of this medicine and out of how many times user should take this medicine.
